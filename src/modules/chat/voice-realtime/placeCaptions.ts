/**
 * Places the provisional caption rows of a Live Voice session among the real transcript rows by
 * TIME instead of appending them at the end.
 *
 * WHY. The captions used to be appended after every real message. The moment the instruction was
 * delivered and Claude began answering, the person's own words (the caption) sat BELOW Claude's reply,
 * repeating the user message above it, and each new caption pushed the reply up the screen — read by
 * the user as "the reasoning appeared and then went away".
 *
 * A caption goes immediately before the first real row stamped later than it; one with no later row
 * goes last; rows whose time cannot be read keep their place and never move a caption. Order within
 * the real rows and within the captions is preserved.
 *
 * Consumed by `ChatInterface` (the pane that renders both).
