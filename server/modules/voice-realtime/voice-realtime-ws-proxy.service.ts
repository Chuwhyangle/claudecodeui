/**
 * The `/voice-realtime` WebSocket handler — the browser's half of a Realtime
 * voice connection (GOAL-031 / AC-312).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. AC-310 wired the Realtime TOOL table to the real MCP services
 * (`voice-realtime-live-executor.ts`) and AC-311 made the bridge survive a
 * dropped connection, but both are server-side leaves: nothing let a BROWSER
 * open a Realtime session. This handler is that wire. It sits between the
 * browser socket and a real DashScope transport, so the credentials stay on the
 * server (the browser never dials the upstream itself) and the browser speaks
 * one small JSON protocol rather than DashScope's.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO INTENT CONFIRMATION (GOAL-033 / AC-316). Earlier builds
 * surfaced the model's proposed `session_send` as an editable draft and
 * awaited a browser `decision` frame before calling the real AC-310 handler.
 * AC-316 removed that step: Live Voice is a continuous-capture mode with no
 * per-utterance confirmation UI, so `session_send` now executes the moment the
 * model calls it. The bridge routes `function_call` frames straight into the
 * executor's routing table and exposes no `onFunctionCall` hook — deliberately,
 * so the bridge stays an offline-provable leaf — so this handler's executor
 * wrapper is now a thin single-flight guard rather than a confirmation gate.
 *
 * WHAT THE BROWSER MAY SAY (inbound, one JSON object per frame):
 *   - `{ type: 'audio', audio }`  — one base64 PCM frame from the capture
 *     pipeline (microphone or an injected test file), sent only while the
 *     browser is not muted.
 *   - `{ type: 'close' }` — the browser is done; the upstream is closed.
 *
 * WHAT THE SERVER SAYS (outbound):
 *   - `{ type: 'state', state }`   — the bridge's connection state.
 *   - `{ type: 'sent', sessionId, result }` — the real `session_send` answer.
 *   - `{ type: 'error', code, message }` — a reported bridge/transport failure.
 *
 * The tool whitelist that pins every send onto the connection's one session is
 * NOT re-implemented here: the executor the caller injects is
 * `createVoiceRealtimeLiveExecutor`, whose `boundSessionId` already refuses a
 * call naming another session. This handler only decides WHEN a send happens,
 * never WHICH session it reaches.
